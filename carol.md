# Carol
## This is my lovely cat Carol

She is a brown tabby cat. I adopted her from the shelter when she was 1 year old.
Carol had been a street cat and already had 4 kittens when she arrived at the shelter.
She was very independent and touch-averse for the first few years. She left the house whenever she wanted and returned at her own leisure.
I never could have tried to make her an indoor cat... I was just happy she always came back home.

I have had Carol for 7 years now. She no longer hates being pet or held and she actually tries to come sleep with me almost every night.
Unless my dad is home... she loves my dad more than anyone. I cannot compete.
